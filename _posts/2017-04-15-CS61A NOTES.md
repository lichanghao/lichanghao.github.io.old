# CS61A NOTES

## Leture 1
*The introduction to this course and other notions*

The ability to explain things to other people is important and what you will learn from your university.  

Build good habits now for success in the future. Do not copy but you can learn from other people.

Type of expressions.

An expression describes a computation and evaluates to a value.	

Operator, operand.

Objects and methods.

Sets.

How to make a list reversed: `w[::-1]`

## Reading

When Python evaluates an expression, it computes the value of expression.

Some guiding principles of debugging are:

1. Test incrementally
2. Isolate errors
3. Check your assumptions
4. Consult others

## Lecture 2
*Some base features and concepts of Python*

Built-in functions, Modules, Types of expressions

Assignment statements, left to right

All the name in Python is Reference. It is very importance to understand this property.

Function signature, function body

Environment, frame

None: None represent nothing in Python, a function that does not explicitly return a value will return a None. 
Pure functions, Non-pure functions

## Reading

Def statements and assignment bind names to values, and any existing binding previous are lost.

Boxes(Environment): a sequence of frames. And the concept: Global frame

A name evaluates to the value bound to that name in the earliest frame of the current environment in which that name is found. 

A new local frame is introduced every time a function is called, even if the same function is called twice.
Some shared coding conventions:

	
1. Function names are lowercase, with words separated by underscores. Descriptive names are encouraged.

2. Function names typically evoke operations applied to arguments by the interpreter (e.g., `print`, `add`, `square`) or the name of the quantity that results (e.g., max, abs, sum).

3. Parameter names are lowercase, with words separated by underscores. Single-word names are preferred.

4. Parameter names should evoke the role of the parameter in the function, not just the kind of argument that is allowed.

5. Single letter parameter names are acceptable when their role is obvious, but avoid "l" (lowercase ell), "O" (capital oh), or "I" (capital i) to avoid confusion with numerals.
Abstract and hide the details of a function: the domain, the range, the relationship between input and output, side effects.

The qualities of a good function:

1. Each function should have exactly one job. One should divide multi-jobs function into small functions. 

2. Try to avoid copying and pasting a block of code, using functional abstraction.

3. Functions should be defined generally.


Use docstring and notes to make functions and codes more readable. 

Use `help <function_name> `to check the docstring of a function.

Python 没有赋值表达式。形如`x = 1`这样的语句不是一个表达式，也没有返回值。

Python中的变量全部都是引用，变量不是一块内存，而是一块内存上的标签。
