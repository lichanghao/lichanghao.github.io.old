# CS61A NOTES

## Leture 1
*The introduction to this course and other notions*

T**he ability to explain things** to other people is important and what you will learn from your university.  

Build good habits now for success in the future. Do not copy but you can learn from other people.

Type of expressions.

An **expression** describes a computation and evaluates to a value.	
**Operator**, **operand**.

**Objects** and **methods**.

Sets.

How to make a list reversed: `w[::-1]`

## Reading

When Python evaluates an expression, it computes the value of expression.

Some guiding principles of debugging are:

1. Test incrementally
2. Isolate errors
3. Check your assumptions
4. Consult others

## Lecture 2
*Some base features and concepts of Python*

**Built-in functions**, **Modules**, Types of expressions

**Assignment statements**, left to right

All the name in Python is **Reference**. It is very importance to understand this property.

**Function signature**, **function body**

**Environment**, **frame**

**None**: None represent nothing in Python, a function that does not explicitly return a value will return a None. 
Pure functions, Non-pure functions

## Reading

Def statements and assignment **bind names to values**, and any existing binding previous are lost.

Boxes(Environment): a sequence of frames. And the concept: **Global frame**

A name evaluates to the value bound to that name in the earliest frame of the current environment in which that name is found. 

A new local frame is introduced every time a function is called, even if the same function is called twice.

Some shared coding conventions:

1. Function names are lowercase, with words separated by underscores. Descriptive names are encouraged.

2. Function names typically evoke operations applied to arguments by the interpreter (e.g., `print`, `add`, `square`) or the name of the quantity that results (e.g., max, abs, sum).

3. Parameter names are lowercase, with words separated by underscores. Single-word names are preferred.

4. Parameter names should evoke the role of the parameter in the function, not just the kind of argument that is allowed.

5. Single letter parameter names are acceptable when their role is obvious, but avoid "l" (lowercase ell), "O" (capital oh), or "I" (capital i) to avoid confusion with numerals.
Abstract and hide the details of a function: the domain, the range, the relationship between input and output, side effects.

The qualities of a good function:

1. Each function should have exactly one job. One should divide multi-jobs function into small functions. 

2. Try to avoid copying and pasting a block of code, using functional abstraction.

3. Functions should be defined generally.


Use **docstring** and **notes** to make functions and codes more readable. 

Use `help <function_name> `to check the docstring of a function.

Python 没有赋值表达式。形如`x = 1`这样的语句不是一个表达式，也没有返回值。

Python中的变量全部都是引用，变量不是一块内存，而是一块内存上的标签。

## Lecture 3


## Reading

**Control Statements**: control the flow of a program's execution, they have no value. They determine what the intepreter should do next.

**Simple statements and compound statements**: simple statements end without a colon. Just like

```python
return mul(x,x) # a simple statement

def square(x):
	return mul(x,x) # a compound statement
```

**Indention**: use spaces instead of tabs to indent codes, because the lenth of tabs is different in different OS.

**Local assignments**: binding names in local frame, not influencing the global frame.

**Boolean contexts**: In Python, 0, `None`, and `false` are false values. All other numbers are true values. Every *built-in kind* of data in Python has both true and false values.

**Boolean operators**: sometimes they are determined without evaluating all of its subexpressions, a feature called *short-circuiting*. 

**Iteration**: press *crtl+c* to force Python to stop looping.

**Testing**:

Assertions.

```python
assert fib(8) == 13, 'The 8th Fibonacci number should be 13' # the string will be displayed if the expreession evaluates to a false value.
```

 Doctests.

```python
def sum_naturals(n):
        """Return the sum of the first n natural numbers.

        >>> sum_naturals(10)
        55
        >>> sum_naturals(100)
        5050
        """
        total, k = 0, 1
        while k <= n:
            total, k = total + k, k + 1
        return total
```

```python 
>>> from doctest import testmod
>>> testmod() # to verify the functions in the global frame
TestResults(failed=0, attempted=2)
```

```python
>>> from doctest import run_docstring_examples
>>> run_docstring_examples(sum_naturals, globals(), True)
Finding tests in NoName
Trying:
    sum_naturals(10)
Expecting:
    55
ok
Trying:
    sum_naturals(100)
Expecting:
    5050
ok
```

When writing Python in files, all doctests in a file can be run by starting Python with the doctest command line option:

```python3 -m doctest <python_source_file>```
