# Daily Recording for March 2019

# 3/25/2019

1. Getting up at 7AM, but fall sleeping again, then really getting up at 8AM.

2. Swimming from 9AM to 9:40AM

3. Two math classes from 10:15AM to 12:00AM, which I did not pay much attention to 

4. Lunch with Xi Chen from 12:20PM to 1:00PM

5. Researching in MSC (mainly discussed with Tianwu about 2 hours, wrote a short Mathematica code for 3D transformation of stiffness tensor, recompute several MD simulations, finished the diamond project slides for the collaborators) from 1:20PM to 8PM (Dinner time was about 1 hour)

6. Practicing oral (my 100 hours project) for 30 mins

7. Took 1 hour reading the book Time as a Friend, very roughly but inspired me a lot.

8. Went to sleep at 12:30AM.
