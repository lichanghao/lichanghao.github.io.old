Recently I has been crazily writing papers for previously stacked unpublished works, and today just got one paper rejected by the editor of *Nature Communications*. When I am reading the highly-cited paper on prestigous journals such as *Nature*, *Science*, *PNAS*, I am always impressed by their efforts and skills shown in writing and figures. Their wording is so clear and fine-tuned, and their figures are so rich and well-designed. I always try to imitate their styles but can not really approach their quality. However, I still observed some good characteristics shared by those impressive papers.
