This is the development log for a project I was recently working on.

## Formalism

Consider an closed elastic membrane, whose total Helmholtz free energy can be written as:

$$E_{el}=\int_{A}\frac{k}{2}(\kappa-c_0)^2dA \label{eq1}\tag1$$

where $k$ is the bending modulus, $\kappa(\mathbf{r})$ is the local curvature, and $c_0$ is the spontaneous curvature. Note that, in Eq($\ref{eq1}$) we neglect the contribution of surface energy and gaussian curvature.

As stated in [2008 Qiang Du et al.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00285-007-0118-2), the above energy can be reformulated in a way of phase-field modeling, by

$$ E_{el}=\int_{\Omega} \frac{k}{2\epsilon}(\epsilon\Delta\phi+(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\phi+c_0\sqrt{2})(1-\phi^2))^2dV \label{eq2}\tag2$$

where $c_0$ is the spontaneous curvature, $\phi$ (ranging from $-1$ to $1$) is the order parameter indicating the membrane shape, and $\epsilon$ is the parameter controling the gradient thickness for $\phi$. The integral is performed on the whole 3D domain $\Omega$, which avoids explicitly tracking the moving interface.

The Equation (\ref{eq2}) is the continuum version of the membrane elastic bending energy. To model the two-phase membrane, we need to introduce one additional order parameter $\eta$, ranging from $-1$ to $1$ also, to indicate the phase separation on the membrane. Since the phase boundary normally introduces extra elastic energy, here we define the line tension (interfacial energy) between two phases ($\eta = -1$ and $\eta = 1$) as:

$$ L = \int_{l} \gamma_0 dl \label{eq3}\tag3 $$

which is simply the line integral of the interfacial energy density $\gamma_0$. Similarly, the continuum version of Equation (\ref{eq3}) is:

$$ L(\phi, \eta) = \int_{\Omega}\delta [\frac{\epsilon}{2}|\nabla\phi|^2 + \frac{1}{4\epsilon}(\phi^2-1)^2][\frac{\xi}{2}|\nabla\eta|^2 + \frac{1}{4\xi}(\eta^2-1)^2]d\Omega \label{eq4}\tag4$$

where $\delta$ is the magnitude of line tension, $\epsilon$ and $\xi$ are   parameters controlling the interfacial thickness of $\phi$ and $\eta$, respectively. Apparently, the energy density of $L(\phi, \eta)$ only take non-zero value near the phase bounaries, which is exactly what we want, to automatically tracking the moving bounadries again.
