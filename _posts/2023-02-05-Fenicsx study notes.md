This note records my study route of FEniCS, an open-source finite element library.

## About FEniCS

FEniCS is an acronym with FE representing finite element, CS representing computational software. The FEniCS software package was originally compiled at the University of Chicago, whose mascot is a phoenix, which likely inspired the name. 

Beginning from 2018, the FEniCS project adapted a new framework, including multiple building blocks: UFL, Basix, FFCx and DOLFINx. The legacy version of FEniCS is composed of UFL, FIAT, FFC and DOLFIN. There are multiple versions of documentations/tutorials online, for both newest release and the legacy version. Also, the questions/answers online are based on different versions. **The grammar for FEniCSx and its legacy version is quite different. Newest version is recommended.**
