My first glance at [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/) is in my last year in college. Backing to that time, I was exchanging in the University of Tokyo for the whole semester, and luckily have some toy reserach work to do. Then, I heard something very bad happened on my old friend and I also got stucked on the research project. I was totally feel gerieved and lost at that time, and this is when the LeetCode idea comes to me, because it is conceptually simple and needs tons of efforts to be skillful. I always take LeetCode as a way of recreation, so that I can really concentrate on something, forget about sorrows, and get some positive feedbacks.

After coming to Penn State I rarely re-pick LeetCode, but in mid 2022 I literally took several weeks to complete near 300 problems and systematically learned algorithms and data structures. I have mixed reasons: for fun and for possible future career. I never actually thinking about turn my career direction to developer because I am still dreaming about entering academia and find a position in my country. Anyway, this indeed gives me one more option, and who knows I can really benefit from it or not? There is another important reason for doing LeetCode. My ex was suffering a lot from her advisor and reserarch direction, and I think the best way out is all-in coding training and targeting at finding a job in tech company. Considering her impressive intelligence I don't think this is really hard. So I re-started the LeetCode journey and ready to support her in both academic and emotional ways. However, we finally broke up (sad story) after two months and I found a internship position in Dassault Systeme, so that was probably the end of the day for me to treat LeetCode very seriously.
