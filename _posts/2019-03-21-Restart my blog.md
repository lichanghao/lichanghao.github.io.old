# Restart my Blog

It has been **one and half year** since I posted my last blog [**Install Mpich1.4 and ifort under Ubuntu system**](https://lichanghao.github.io/features/2017/08/15/Install-Mpich1.4-and-ifort-under-Ubuntu-system/). It was truely very long time. During this period, I graduated from my undergrad university, experienced a lot, set my foot on many places, and went through several failures. Everying goes fine by now, and I started my Ph.D of Engineering Mechanics in Penn State, following my advisor for previous summer research. I will talk more later on the next blogs, but now it is more important to announce (mainly to my self), I restarted my blog!

## Why I abandoned writting blog

- Main reason, I am literally very lazy and easy to lose motivation for many thing (**one of my deadly weakness**). I have realized that for quite a long time, and trying to correct this (do my best).

- Second reason, writing blog needs me to be **highly concentrated** (or produce some crap), **fully motivated** (or produce something unfinished), and **be well-organized** (or produce something myself cannot even understand after days). So writing blog is kind of demanding, and I am happen to be a perfectionist. Here is a sudo-formula that I realized after several failure:

```
perfectionism + laziness = doing nothing and totally failing
```

So from the formula you can clearly see why I had a good start, but abandoned finally.

## Why I want to restart

- Recording: A blog can record my **occasional inspirations**, **memorable events**, and **technical details** that I may need after several monthes later. There is no need to say Github is better than white paper.

- Practicing lunguages: Even in my mother lunguage Chinese, I am very unconfident about my writting. So no matter which lunguage I am using to write this blog, updating blog is a good training for my overall writting skills.

- Train my patience: In many occasions, **patience is the key to making progress then finishing a task**, which has been proved by my own experience.


## What I will do

- I will update a blog **twice a month at least**. 

- I will write new blogs mainly in English.

- Sharing some memorable moment of my life, maybe in the form of Vlog.

- Recording interesting problems I meet during courses and research, the procedure of solving technical problems, and my own reflection on issues.

- Sharing some toy code developed by myself.

- Any other interesting things in my point of view......

**Let's see how long I can stick to this! At least this moment I am confident...... Who knows?**
